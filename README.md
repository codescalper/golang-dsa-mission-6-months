# Data Structures and Algorithms in Go

This repository contains implementations of various data structures and algorithms in Go programming language.

## Structure

- `arrays/`: Array-based problems and solutions
- `linkedlists/`: Linked List implementations and problems
- `stacks/`: Stack implementations and related problems
- `queues/`: Queue implementations and related problems
- `trees/`: Tree data structures (Binary Trees, BST, AVL, etc.)
- `graphs/`: Graph algorithms and implementations
- `sorting/`: Various sorting algorithms
- `searching/`: Searching algorithms
- `dynamicprogramming/`: Dynamic programming problems
- `greedy/`: Greedy algorithm problems
- `backtracking/`: Backtracking problems
- `util/`: Utility functions

## How to Use

Each folder contains implementations of specific data structures or algorithms, along with problem solutions.

```bash
# Run a specific algorithm
go run arrays/two_sum/two_sum.go

# Run tests for a specific implementation
go test ./arrays/two_sum
```
